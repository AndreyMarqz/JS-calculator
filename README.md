## 🧠 What I Learned

Building this project was a deep dive into frontend fundamentals. Key takeaways include:

1.  **JavaScript Logic:**
    * Implemented algorithms to handle calculation chains.
    * Created the logic for the "Clear" button (removing the last string character) and "Reset/AC" functionality.
2.  **Debugging & Problem Solving:**
    * Fixed various bugs related to floating-point precision.
    * Solved edge cases, such as preventing the user from entering multiple decimal points in a single number.
3.  **UI/UX & Responsiveness:**
    * Designed a layout that adjusts to different screen sizes using CSS Media Queries.
    * improved user experience with visual feedback on button clicks.
