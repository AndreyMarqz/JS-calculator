## 📋 Features

* **Arithmetic Operations:** Performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
* **Editing Tools:** Includes `DEL` (delete last digit) and `RESET`/`C` (clear all) functionality.
* **Responsive Design:** Fully adaptable layout that works seamlessly on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
* **Error Handling:** Prevents invalid input sequences (e.g., multiple decimal points).
* **Modern UI:** Clean interface with interactive hover and click states.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **HTML5:** Semantic structure.
* **CSS3:** Flexbox/Grid for layout, media queries for responsividade, and styling.
* **JavaScript (ES6+):** Core logic, event listening, and DOM manipulation.

## 🧠 What I Learned

Building this project was a deep dive into frontend fundamentals. Key takeaways include:

1.  **JavaScript Logic:**
    * Implemented algorithms to handle calculation chains.
    * Created the logic for the "Delete" button (removing the last string character) and "Reset" functionality.
2.  **Debugging & Problem Solving:**
    * Fixed various bugs related to floating-point precision.
    * Solved edge cases, such as preventing the user from entering multiple decimal points in a single number.
3.  **UI/UX & Responsiveness:**
    * Designed a layout that adjusts to different screen sizes using CSS Media Queries.
    * improved user experience with visual feedback on button clicks.
